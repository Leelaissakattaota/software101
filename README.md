# NumPy Array Addition

This project demonstrates basic element-wise addition of two vectors using the **NumPy** library in Python.

## Project Description
The script creates two 1D arrays (vectors) and calculates their sum.
* **Array A:** `[5, 3, 1]`
* **Array B:** `[3, 2, 1]`
* **Result (C):** `[8, 5, 2]`

## Prerequisites
